# Toxic Comment Classifier
#### Project Objective
Humans have developed diverse models for communicating their thoughts through a lot of devices. The internet has been a boon for so many years. But nowadays individuals are found to be at the other end of rising levels of Cyberbullying or social media abuse. Racism, Hate, Casteism in the comments sections of social media posts have many people disgusted and alarmed. To create a safe environment for all the people on the Internet, social media companies need to filter, block, and takedown offensive posts. Enhancement to the existing model will ideally lead to more constructive and respectful online discussion. </p>

#### Dataset Description
It's important to recognize and exclude malicious content from public platforms. Human moderators can't analyze a large corpus of comments. Our strategy is to implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to build a rapid and robust method for detecting online toxicity. We are using Google AI Jigsaw Dataset for Toxic Comment classification. We'll create a multi-label model for detecting different types of social media abuse.
